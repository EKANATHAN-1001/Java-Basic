Input: a1b2c3
Output: abbccc

Caution: Don't use inbuilt functions

Explanation:
After we have the number 1 so a repeats one time = a
After b we have the number 2 so it repeats two times = bb
After c we have the number 3 so it repeats three times = ccc
Final Output: abbccc

Algorithm:
1.Start the Program
2.Get the input as a single string
3.Loop through the entire string to find the numbers
4.After finding the number, Repeat the previous character the same number of times
5.For example a4 ( So you find the number 4 and print a 4 times)
6.Follow step 3,4 for the entire string
7.End the Program
